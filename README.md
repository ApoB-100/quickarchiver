=============

Thunderbird Extension 

* While moving mails, QuickArchiver will remember the destination-folder and add an rule for it (default is by sender-address)
* All mails applying to that rule will get a link in the extra column to move the mail quickly
* Right-click on that link you can edit the rule (and also delete it)
* Rules can be applied by Sender, Destination or Subject
