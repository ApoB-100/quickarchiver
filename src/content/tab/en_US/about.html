                <h2>What is QuickArchiver?</h2>

                <p>QuickArchiver helps you to keep your inbox clean: Instead of first searching for the right folder for
                    each email and then dragging and dropping the email, all it takes now is a single click (or key
                    combination).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>How does QuickArchiver work?</h2>

                    <p>QuickArchiver uses its own rules to remember the appropriate folder for an email. Currently the
                        rules can consist of sender, recipient or subject. </p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Create (default) rule</h3>
                    <p>The first time you move an email (that does not yet have a matching rule) to a folder,
                        QuickArchiver automatically creates a rule based on the sender of the email.</p>

                    <h3>Archive emails (move)</h3>
                    <p>If there are more emails with the same sender, QuickArchiver offers to move them to the
                        appropriate folder with just one click.</p>

                    <h3>Context menu</h3>
                    <p>Right-click on the QuickArchiver button to open the context menu.</p>

                <h2>FAQ</h2>

                <h3>How can I archive all emails of a certain domain into one folder?</h3>

                <p>The default rule refers to the entire sender address. If you want to archive all emails of a certain
                    domain, e.g. @amazon.com into one folder, edit the rule and remove the corresponding characters
                    before the @.</p>

                <h3>Can I archive multiple emails at the same time?</h3>

                <p>It is possible! With the shortcut ALT+A QuickArchiver moves all selected emails into the respective
                    folders.</p>

            <h2>Release Notes</h2>

            <h3>Version 2.0</h3>

            <p>The new version of Thunderbird 115.* (Supernova) requires deep changes to QuickArchiver. The old
                QuickArchiver 0.2 branch will therefore no longer work and thus will not be developed further. The last
                Thunderbird updates had already announced it: only with effort and unattractive compromises
                QuickArchiver could continue to work.</p>

            <p>The good news: there is a new version and you have just installed it!</p>

            <p>New features:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Complete new development based on the current WebExtension API from Mozilla. Future updates are
                    easier with this!
                </li>
                <li>Rules are stored in the WebExtension storage</li>
                <li>Rules are potentially available across devices (on the roadmap)</li>
                <li>New UI: Toolbar button, menu and keyboard shortcuts</li>
                <li>New UI: improved rule editor and list of all rules</li>
                <li> Rule creation happens as usual automatically when moving emails</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Some disadvantages, which can not be prevented according to the current state:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>All rules have to be created again. An update of the old rule database to the new structure would be
                    very time-consuming.
                </li>
                <li> There is no QuickArchiver column in the list anymore. This is no longer possible with the current
                    Thunderbird version, but should probably be possible again in future versions for WebExtensions. It
                    is also not yet clear how the previous operation can be implemented with the new "card view". The
                    operation is now done via toolbar buttons and keyboard shortcuts.
                </li>
